#### Hello!

My name is Jocelyn and I am a 2nd year MPH student in the Biostatistics department at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. My certificate is in Advanced Epidemiology. I am also a TA for a Quantitative Foundations class for the first year MPH research methods course. In other words, my day to day usually looks something like this:

When I'm not busy with my typical graduate student responsibilities (studying, writing assignments, coding ~cries in R~), I am usually grading Quant homeworks. Just kidding ~~(not really)~~. I am usually on the hunt for the perfect soup dumplings in the New York area!

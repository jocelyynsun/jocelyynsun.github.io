### Meet Jocelyn

<img src="images/photo.jpg">

Hello! My name is Jocelyn and I am an LA native. I currently attend Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health where I study biostatistics and epidemiology.    

If you would like to learn more about my professional background, please see my [resume](about.html).

  
### Hobbies
When I'm not busy with my typical graduate student responsibilities, I am usually out in search of the *perfect* soup dumplings!  


I also enjoy having an active lifestyle and have found a love for hiking in the upstate New York area. Here's the view of a recent one I went on!

I'm fairly obsessed with my sister's dog, Diamond. She's an 11-year-old lab/pitty rescue, with the sweetest soul! This is my favorite picture of her:
